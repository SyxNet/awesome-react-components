# Creative Stuff

<em>
Libraries with a "oh wow that's a neat idea" effect.

I'm curious about new types of libraries. Especially because React allows a whole new range of libraries that previously were very difficult to implement.

If there are several libraries implementing the same creative idea, then please add the oldest one.

# List Virtualization

<em>
Display a huge list of entries but only render the entries that are visible.

I have a large list of several thousands of entries that I want to show to the user.

I want to dispaly the entire list without pagination. But rendering all thousands of entries is performance-wise unpractical.

Instead of rendering all entries at once, the entries should be rendered only when they become visible as the user scrolls up and down the list. This technique is called "virtualization" or "lazy load".

What React libraries are there to achieve that?
</em>

# Overlay

<em>Display a view in a large modefull popup.

It should be "modefull", i.e. it should be blocking in the sense that the user has to interact with or close that new view before proceeding.

For example a "yes/no" dialog or a modal to temporary show more information.

Such popup is also called overlay, modal, alert, dialog, or lightbox.

What react context menu libraries are there?
</em>

- [react-contextmenu](https://github.com/vkbansal/react-contextmenu)







# Sticky

<em>
Make sure that an element is always visible.

The W3C added a specification for `position: sticky` which is great but not implemented in all browsers yet.

The library doesn't need to be a polyfill that complies 100% to the spec.

I just want to make sure that an element is always visible. And I don't want to use `position: fixed` because the element should scroll with the rest of the content and "detach" itself when needs be. Basically the element should switch between "position: static" and "position: fixed". See the W3C `position: sticky` for more information.

Such feature is often used for section headers; For small mobile screens you sometimes get "lost" scrolling within the content of a section and with lost I mean that you don't know in what section you are currently browsing. Sticky makes sure that the current section header is always shown.

Are there libraries to achieve stickyness for a React app?
</em>

 - [react-sticky-node](https://github.com/visortelle/react-sticky-node) - Sticky react component.









# Scroll Up Header

<em>
Hide the header when scrolling down and show it again when scrolling up.

To save vertical space, many mobile apps implement a header that disapears when scrolling down. The user scrolls up to access the header again.
Chrome for mobile does that for example.

Are there such libraries for React?
</em>

 - [react-headroom](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/react-headroom) - Hide your header until you need it.

# Async Route

<em>

# Async Component

<em>
Create asynchronous components, i.e. components that need to fetch data over the network.

I have components that need data from the server. For every such component I have to implement the same logic to manage the cycle "initial render with missing data -> fetch data -> re-render with retrieved data". Are there libraries implementing that logic allowing me to easily create asynchronous components?

# Inline CSS

<em>
Extend inline styles to support more CSS features.

Inline styles are very convenient (using JavaScript to generate styles, no global css classes pollution) but one thing I'm missing is CSS selectors like `.parent > .child` or more interesstingly `.child + .child {margin-top: 10px}`, `.child:not(:hover) {opacity: 0.2}`, media queries, etc. These aren't easily possible with React inline styles.

Are there libraries that allow me to write such CSS within my React components?

# Local CSS class

<em>
Locally scoped CSS classes.

Styles are often only applied to one part of the application. In that case having CSS classes be globally scoped is inconvenient.

Even though they allow styles to be scoped locally, I'm not interested in inline style libraries; I want to be able to define styles with CSS3 in .css files with preprocessors of my choice. (E.g. it ain't trivial to use SASS or PostCSS with inline styles.) I just want these classes to be local!

# Lazy Load Component

<em>
Lazy load arbitrary components.

Some components are expensive to render and we want to render them only when they are visible to the user. This technique is also called virtualization.

Most virtualization libraries assume that the components to be lazy loaded are entries of a list and it is assumed that they are are all siblings and children of one same parent component.
It is not the case in our application and the expensive components to be lazy loaded are scattered around the app.

Are there libraries that allow to lazy load components at arbitrary position? Ideally the library would pass a prop `isVisible` to the expensive components so they can render a cheap-to-render placeholder when `isVisible===false`.
